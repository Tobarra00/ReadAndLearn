    <h2>How to make it work üîß</h2>
    <p>In this section I will show step by step how to make this code work:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <code>git clone</code> to clone the repository. After that, create a virtual environment with:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>pip install virtualenv</code><br><br></li>
            <li><code>virtualenv venv</code><br><br></li>
        </ul>
        After that, activate the virtual environment and use this command to install the requirements to make the project work properly:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code><br><br></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The next step is to manage the database. Create a local postgresql database and fill the <code>NAME</code>, <code>USER</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code> fields in the <code>settings.py</code> file. To continue, apply the migrations:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><code>python manage.py makemigrations</code><br><br></li>
                <li><code>python manage.py migrate</code><br><br></li>
            </ul>
          Now you should have everything set up, except for the actual books. I have created a custom command to load books into the database. Use the <code>books.json</code> file to do so. If you want to add more books to the database, you should use the same format.
          Once you have all the books you want, load them into the database with the command:<br><br>
          <ul>
                <li><code>python manage.py load_books</code><br><br></li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, if everything went right, you should be able to run the server and visualize the website and utilize its functionalities by using the command:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><code>python manage.py runserver</code><br><br></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>And that's all, you should be able to navigate and try the website with all of its functionallity üòâ.<br><br></li>
    </ol>
